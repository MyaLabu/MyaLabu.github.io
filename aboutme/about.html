    <p>  
        Hi, I'm Mya LaBuguen. I was born in Janesville, WI. I graduate from Craig high school in 2027. I previously<br>
         worked at Forest of Freaks during the month of October. That job taught me how to over come difficult<br>
         struggles that came up quickly. In my middle school, I was in a club called Free Press where you could write<br>
         stories for the local newspaper. The club taught me how to be more independent and it also really improved<br>
         my writing skills. I also help set up a charity event at my friends local church, helping kids in need and<br> 
         supplying them with clothes and school supplys. One of my favorite hobbys is riding dirtbikes.<br>
         I first started riding in my backyard when I was ten. Then, overtime I moved to more trails.</p>
