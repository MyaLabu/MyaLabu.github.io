    <h1>Get to Know Me!</h1><div><div>
    <p>I was born in Janesville, WI. I graduated from Criag highschool in 2027. I previously worked at Forest of Freaks
         during the month of October. That job had taught me how to over come difficult struggles that quickly came up. 
         In my middle school, I was in a club called Free Press where you could write stories for the local newspaper.
         The club taught me how to be more independent and it really improved my writing skills.</p>
