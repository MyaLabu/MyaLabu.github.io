    <h3>Mya LaBuguen</h1><div><hr><div>
    <p>In my free time, I like to write stories or be creative in anyway I can. However, I also take great passion in 
        motocross. I like to get outside and race with my father whenever I can.. <div>

        Agreeing to work with me would include a creatively built website that meets your standards. You would list all
         of the necessities you need and I would turn it into a fuctuning website. With my work, you will recive
         a creative website that includes everything you need.
